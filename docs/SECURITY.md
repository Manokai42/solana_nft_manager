# Security Guidelines

## Dependency Management and Security

### Known Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

1. **@solana/web3.js (v1.87.6)**
   - Keep updated with the latest security patches
   - Monitor for potential RPC endpoint vulnerabilities
   - Consider implementing additional validation for transaction signing

2. **node-fetch (v2.7.0)**
   - Consider upgrading to v3.x for newer projects
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
   - Add request timeouts and proper error handling

3. **electron (Desktop App)**
   - Ensure CSP headers are properly configured
   - Disable Node integration in renderer process
   - Validate all IPC communication

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Security**
   - Use rate limiting (implemented via `express-rate-limit`)
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use Helmet.js for security headers
   - Keep API keys secure using environment variables

2. **Wallet Security**
   - Never store private keys in plaintext
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure connection for all wallet operations
   - Validate all transaction data before signing

3. **Desktop Application Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Automatic updates with signature verification
   - Secure local storage encryption
   - Proper handling of deep links

npm update

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix security vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

### Desktop Application
```bash
# Update desktop app dependencies
cd desktop
npm update
npm audit
```
